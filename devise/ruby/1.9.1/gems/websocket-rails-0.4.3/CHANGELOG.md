* Fix bug in ControllerFactory#reload! that prevented the handling of
internal events when running in the Development environment. Fixes issue #50. - Thanks to @nessche

* Only reload controller classes when Rails config.cache_classes is set

## Version 0.4.0

__There have been a few breaking changes in the public API since the
last release. Please review the list below and consult the Wiki for more
information regarding the usage of the new features.__

* Controller instances no longer persist between events that are
  triggered. Each event is processed by a new controller instance,
similar to a standard Rails request. Since you can no longer use
instance variables to temporarily persist data between events, there is
a new Controller Data Store that can be used for this purpose. This
change addresses issue #31.

* The original DataStore class has been deprecated. In it's place are
  the new Controller Data Store and Connection Data Store. As mentioned
above, the Controller Data Store can be used to persist data between
events in much the same way that you would use instance variables. The
Connection Data Store acts like the Rails session store. Use it to store
data private to a connection. Data in the Connection Data Store can be
accessed from any controller. Check out the Wiki for more information on
both.

* The `websocket_rails.reload_controllers` event has been deprecated.
  The new Controller instantiation model allows for automatic controller
class reloading while in the development environment. You no longer
need to trigger an event to pick up code changes in controllers while
connections are active.

* Real logging support has _finally_ been implemented. Check out the
  configuration WIki for more information on the various logging options
available.

## Version 0.3.0

February 6 2013

* Extend the event router DSL to accept routes similar to the routes.rb
  shorthand `controller#action`. - Thanks to @nessche.

* Add a custom RSpec matcher suite for verifying event routes
  and easily asserting that WebsocketRails controller actions are
  triggering  events correctly. - Also thanks to @nessche.

* Fix fiber yielded across threads bug when running in standalone mode
  by disabling Thin threaded mode as default option.

## Version 0.2.1

based web servers.
